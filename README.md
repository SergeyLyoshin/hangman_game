# What's Hangman? Rules of the game:

Console game on Ruby.

The computer thinks out a word (from the list in the file) and shows how many letters there are. The player enters letters one at a time. If a letter is in a word, the computer shows how many times it appears in it and in what places. If there is no letter, the computer counts the error. If the word is correctly guessed, the player wins. After each mistake, the gallows is drawn. There are 7 mistakes you can make.

New words can be added to the `words.txt` file in the `data` folder
